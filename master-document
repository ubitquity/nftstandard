Non-Fungible Titles (NFT) Standards Document

DRAFT -
Version: 0.1
 Date: January 5, 2025
 Prepared by: Nathan Wosnack, Eugene Buchanan, MJ Phillips

1. Introduction
NFTitles represent a digital, immutable, and decentralized framework for property title records, leveraging blockchain technology for security, transparency, and efficiency. This document outlines the standards and best practices for creating, managing, and interacting with NFTitles.

2. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a standardized framework for:
Defining NFTitles and their metadata.
Ensuring interoperability across blockchain networks.
Maintaining legal compliance and data security.
Encouraging trust and adoption among stakeholders.

3. Terminology
NFT (Non-Fungible Token): A unique digital asset stored on a blockchain.
NFTitles: Non-fungible tokens specifically designed to represent property title records.
Smart Contract: A self-executing contract with the terms directly written into code.
Owner: The legal entity or individual holding the NFTitle.
Verifier: A trusted entity responsible for validating title authenticity and data integrity.

4. Technical Standards
4.1 Blockchain Protocol
NFTitles must be deployed on a blockchain that supports:
Smart Contracts: E.g., Ethereum, Polygon, or similar.
Security Features: Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake (PoS).
Scalability: Ability to handle high transaction volumes.
4.2 Token Standards
NFTitles should comply with the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token standards to ensure interoperability and compatibility.
4.3 Metadata Structure
NFTitle metadata must include the following:
Property Details: Address, legal description, and dimensions.
Owner Information: Name, wallet address, and legal identification.
Transaction History: Timestamped records of transfers and updates.
Verification Data: Links to notarized documents, survey results, and zoning information.
4.4 Smart Contract Requirements
Must include functionality for:
Ownership Transfer: Secure and verifiable title transfers.
Data Updates: Recording changes in property status or ownership.
Revocation Mechanism: Ability to revoke titles in cases of fraud or dispute resolution.

5. Operational Standards
5.1 Title Verification
Verification entities must validate title authenticity using a combination of:
Blockchain transaction records.
Off-chain legal and historical data.
5.2 Compliance
NFTitles must adhere to the jurisdictional laws of the propertyâ€™s location, including:
Real estate regulations.
Privacy and data protection laws.
Tax reporting requirements.
5.3 Security Protocols
Employ multi-signature wallets for sensitive transactions.
Use encrypted storage for off-chain data linked to the NFTitle.
5.4 Interoperability
Support cross-chain integrations to enhance accessibility and reduce platform dependency.

6. Governance
NFTitles should operate under a decentralized governance structure such as nDAO.
 Responsibilities include:
Approving updates to NFTitles standards.
Mediating disputes between parties.
Voting on enhancements to NFTitles smart contracts and platform features.

7. Adoption Roadmap
Phase 1: Implementation
Develop a prototype NFTitle system on a selected blockchain.
Pilot program with early adopters.
Phase 2: Compliance & Standardization
Partner with legal experts to ensure regulatory compliance.
Publish technical documentation for developers.
Phase 3: Scaling & Interoperability
Expand to multiple blockchain ecosystems.
Onboard government agencies and real estate firms.

8. Conclusion
This standards document aims to ensure that NFTitles provide a secure, transparent, and universally accepted system for property title management. Updates to this document will be governed by nDAO and aligned with emerging technologies and legal developments.

Here's the structured Metadata Standard for NFTitles in a more readable format:
